UNION AND INTERSECTION OF LINKED LISTS

In both of my union and intersection functions, I have employed a while loop to iterate through each list (O(n)) and
a search operation on a dictionary (O(1)). This holds good for iterating through both linked lists and so, for the functions
it's a time complexity of O(2n) explicitly, but for all intents and practical purposes, the runtime of the function is
O(n). This holds good for both functions.
