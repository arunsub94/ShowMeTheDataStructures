BLOCKCHAIN IMPLEMENTATION

I have chosen to employ a singly linked list to represent the BlockChain in
this implementation. This is because the operation involved is appending a new
block to the chain and doing this with a linked list takes O(1) time complexity,
in the average & worst case. The space complexity of the linked list would be O(n).
